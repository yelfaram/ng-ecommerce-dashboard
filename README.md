# E-Commerce Dashboard (Angular)

## Project Overview

This is a front-end e-commerce dashboard built with Angular. It was created to develop familiarity with Angular’s core concepts, including services, observables, subjects, and component communication. The dashboard connects to a fake API to display products, supports sidebar filtering, and provides basic cart functionality. The project focuses on front-end design, interaction, and Angular’s reactive features.

## Why This Project Was Created

This project was developed as a hands-on learning exercise to build confidence with Angular 19, TypeScript, and Material-UI components. The primary goal was to gain practical experience with Angular services, subject-based state management, and observables while creating a realistic, multi-page dashboard that could simulate an e-commerce workflow.

## Project Features

- **Product List Page**: Displays a list of products fetched from `https://fakestoreapi.com/products`.
- **Sidebar Filter**: Allows users to filter products by category, price, rating.
- **Cart Page**: Enables users to add and remove products from their cart.
- **Angular Core Concepts**: Built using Angular services, observables, and subjects.
- **Material-UI Components**: Provides responsive and consistent UI elements.
- **Sprint-Based Development**: Completed in structured sprints to simulate iterative feature development.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (Recommended: v16 or later)
- Angular CLI installed globally
